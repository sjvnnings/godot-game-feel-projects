To follow along with the series, simply download or clone the repository, then import "/FPS Base Project/project.godot" into Godot.

Over the course of this series, you will learn tips and tricks to turn the base project into the polished final project. Try running both projects in the editor to see how they differ, you'll likely find that the final project "feels" much better.

You can watch all the videos in this series as they come out on [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlOHXI-AgHCoaTwEXoMfCqGL6RnXkIBhX)
